# 5 Tips for Effective Online Tutoring Sessions

Online tutoring offers incredible flexibility, but getting the most out of each session takes a little preparation. Here are five tips that top-performing ETUTOR students swear by.

## 1. Prepare Your Questions in Advance

Before each session, write down two or three specific questions or topics you want to cover. This keeps the conversation focused and ensures you leave every lesson with real answers — not just a vague sense of progress.

## 2. Use the Whiteboard Actively

The collaborative whiteboard in your LiveKit classroom is there for a reason. Draw diagrams, work through problems step by step, and annotate examples alongside your tutor. Visual learning reinforces concepts far better than listening alone.

## 3. Review Session Recordings

If your tutor enables session recording, make it a habit to rewatch key moments within 24 hours. Spaced repetition — revisiting material shortly after learning it — is one of the most effective study techniques backed by cognitive science.

## 4. Set Clear Goals for Each Week

Use the AI study plan feature to set weekly targets. Whether it is finishing a chapter, mastering a grammar rule, or completing a set of practice problems, having measurable goals keeps you accountable and motivated.

## 5. Stay Consistent with Your Schedule

Consistency beats intensity. Booking regular sessions — even if they are shorter — builds momentum and makes learning a habit rather than a chore. Pair your tutoring schedule with daily streaks on ETUTOR to earn XP and maintain your learning rhythm.
