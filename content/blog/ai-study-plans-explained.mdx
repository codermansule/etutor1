# AI Study Plans Explained

One of ETUTOR's most popular features is the AI-generated study plan. But how does it actually work? Here is a behind-the-scenes look at the technology that creates your personalized learning path.

## How the AI Generates Your Plan

When you request a study plan, the AI considers several inputs: your selected subjects, current skill level, learning goals, available study hours per week, and any upcoming deadlines like exams. It then creates a week-by-week schedule of topics, practice sessions, and milestones designed to get you from where you are to where you want to be.

## Adapting to Your Progress

Your study plan is not static. As you complete lessons, take quizzes, and interact with the AI tutor, the system tracks your performance on each topic. If you master a concept quickly, the plan accelerates. If you struggle with a particular area, it schedules additional review and practice before moving on.

## Integration with Live Lessons

AI study plans work hand-in-hand with your tutoring sessions. The plan can suggest specific topics to discuss with your tutor, and after each lesson, the AI updates your progress based on what you covered. This creates a seamless loop between self-study and instructor-led learning.

## Staying Motivated with Milestones

Each study plan includes clear milestones — finish a chapter, score above 80 percent on a practice test, complete a writing exercise. These milestones tie into ETUTOR's gamification system, earning you XP and badges as you progress through your plan.

## Getting Started

To generate your first study plan, head to your dashboard and select "Create Study Plan." Choose your subject, set your goal, and let the AI do the rest. You can adjust the plan at any time if your schedule or priorities change.
