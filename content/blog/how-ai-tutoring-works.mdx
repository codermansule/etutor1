# How AI Tutoring Works on SBETUTOR

Live tutors are great for in-depth learning, but what about the hours between sessions? That is where our **AI tutor** steps in — available around the clock to keep your momentum going.

## AI Chat

The AI chat is powered by GPT-4o with a custom knowledge base tailored to each subject. Ask questions, get explanations, and dive deeper into topics covered during your live lessons. The AI remembers your conversation context so you can pick up right where you left off.

## Adaptive Quizzes

After each lesson or study session, the AI generates quizzes that match your current level. Answer correctly and the difficulty ramps up. Struggle with a concept and it provides hints, explanations, and simpler questions to help you build confidence before advancing.

## Personalized Study Plans

Based on your quiz performance, lesson history, and learning goals, the AI creates a week-by-week study plan. Each plan includes recommended topics, practice exercises, and target milestones. Plans adjust automatically as your performance data evolves.

## Tier Access

Free users receive five AI messages per day and one quiz per day. Upgrading to Basic or Premium unlocks unlimited AI chat, unlimited quizzes, and full study plan generation. Visit the [pricing page](/pricing) to compare plans.

## Privacy and Safety

All AI interactions are processed securely. Conversations are stored in your account and are never shared with other users. Content filters ensure the AI stays on topic and provides educationally appropriate responses.
